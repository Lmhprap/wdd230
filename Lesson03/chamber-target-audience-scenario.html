        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p> The goal of the Irvine Chambers of Commerce website is to inform individuals and businesses about the benefits of the Chamber. The driving factor of this site is to build Chamber membership. The benefits of the Chamber are diverse and often too
            vast for your needs, generally chambers have various subsets of their membership collected in various ways. There are topical committees that gather like-minded people and companies together. There are newsletters that go to categories of
            their membership. There are events and content that cater to specific industries or, sometimes even better yet, specific titles. The goal of this site is to provide the necessary information that will help all members and potential members
            understand the enhanced benefits of full membership.
