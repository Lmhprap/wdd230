        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

            <p>
                Under Armour uses a great method of arranging graphic elements by order of importance. By relying on principles relating to size, color, contrast, white and more, you can influence how users interact and they can purchase their services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visual hierarchy affects what you look at and focus on in a design, whether it's an image, graphic design, or web design. It's a key player in ct (i.e., how information is organized and displayed for easy understanding and navigation) and can greatly
                impact the user experience (UX).

        <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
        <div>
            <p><span>Longway Clothing Company</span></p>

            </p>

            <p>
                While the rule of thirds can be a very useful tool, it is not necessary to plan your website design around it. Use the philosophy as a guideline or a tool to tweak your design during the finalizing process. Toss an imaginary grid on a new site design
                and consider making placement changes to items that are close to key spaces on the rule of thirds grid.
            </p>

            <p>
                More importantly, Longway uses the rule of thirds to their working with images on their site. They use it to scale their images. Remember to keep in mind where the object of each photo falls and what kind of movement or feel it creates.

        <h3>Clean Design</h3>
        <div>
            <p><span>Apple Computer</span></p>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://Apple.com/">Apple</a></p>
            <p><img src="images/apple.jpg" alt="Apple Home Page for an example of white space and a clean design">
            </p>
            <p>
                Apple has developed good use of white-space making it a clean and "easy on the eye" design. The spacing around all the objects allows people who are viewing the page to stay calm when people are looking for a product or information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clean design comes mostly from the fact that all the graphics are clearely visable and have the proper amount of â€œWhite Space" in their design.
